          p
            | Failing to make time for personal learning is like planning to fail.

          p
            | If you are not yet convinced that personal learning is a must then you may want to read
            | my article entitled 
            a(href="../../blog/the-continuous-learning-dilemma.html", title="The Continuous Learning Dilemma") "The Continuous Learning Dilemma"
            | . Hopefully this will help you to recognise that personal learning must be treated
            | as an essential part of your work and is therefore a priority.

          h2 Too Busy For Learning

          p
            | Most people who say they "don't have time to learn" really mean they "don't make time
            | to learn". Time management is a skill that needs to be learned and many people,
            | despite many years of working, still haven't got a handle on it.

          p
            | If you find yourself in the position of being too busy to learn because of the 
            | pressures of the "day job" then please take some time to read my article on being 
            a(href="../../blog/crazy-busy.html", title="Crazy Busy") "Crazy Busy"
            | . This will provide you with an escape route to regain control of your work and time
            | so that you can become more pro-active and begin to plan and commit to a regular
            | time for learning.

          h2 Great Things Come From Small Beginnings

          p
            | Start small by making a regular commitment to learning in your calendar.
            | Find a time and place that suits you and guard that time jealously! Occasionally
            | you may need to re-schedule to a different date/time but that's usually rare.

          p 
            | You'll soon discover that taking time out to learn is a refreshing change
            | and you'll probably surprise yourself how quickly you can learn new things
            | when you put your mind to it!
