              h2 Avoiding Endless Searching

              p
                | As an architect I need to be aware of lots of tools, techniques and technologies
                | in order to stay up-to-date. But because these are changing all the time I can't afford
                | to go looking for all of these for myself. I need someone to do it for me.
              
              h2 Find Helpful Websites

              p
                | Fortunately there are plenty of really good websites out there which offer mailing
                | lists that will let you sign up for notifications.

              p
                | It's way better to have information come directly to you than to go looking
                | for it yourself all the time. This approach makes the Internet work for you
                | and can save you a lot of time.

              h2 Not All Mail Is Junk Mail

              p
                | Even after decades of use I'm still not sure if email is a good idea, especially when
                | I hear what percentage of traffic is spam and when I think about phishing attacks
                | and how much time I spend on it.

              p
                | However, in this situation I'm happy to review my inbox every day looking for the odd
                | diamond in the rough.

              p
                | You'll be surprised how often something useful turns up just when you need it. ðŸ˜Š

              h2 Kill Chatty Subscriptions

              p
                | If your mailing list turns out to be too chatty then you can simply unsubscribe.

              p
                | You should also unsubscribe if content is no longer proving valuable to you. 
              
              h2 Forward Useful Content To Your Colleagues

              p
                | When reviewing content I like to recognise and forward items of interest to colleagues.
                | I see it as something that works both ways as some of the best materials I've found have
                | often been sent or pointed out to me by others.

              p
                | This is one way of maximising the value of information and reducing the cost of finding it.
