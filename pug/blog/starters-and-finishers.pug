              h2 Amazing People Classified

              p
                | Over the years I‚Äôve had the privilege of working with many amazing people and very much
                | still enjoy doing so every day. They inspire me, not only with their dexterity and
                | creativity but also with their resolve to get something working or to finish it to a
                | high standard. 

              p
                | Over the years I‚Äôve also noticed that these amazing people often fall distinctly into
                | one of two categories, namely that of either ‚Äústarters‚Äù or ‚Äúfinishers‚Äù. 

              p
                | I‚Äôve discovered it‚Äôs a mindset thing, not related to age or gender.

              h2 Each Completes The Other

              p
                | Starters tend to be the kind of people who like a new challenge and easily get bored
                | doing the same thing over and over, whereas finishers like to master something and then
                | repeat their success. 

              p
                | Starters welcome and adjust easily to change, whereas finishers take a while to adjust
                | to it. However, in the IT industry, neither starter nor finisher can be fully successful
                | without the other. Both are equally necessary to get the job done.

              p
                | It‚Äôs a bit like saying the starter ‚Äúgoes looking for and hooks the fish‚Äù and the finisher
                | ‚Äúlands it‚Äù.

              p
                | These pairings and relationships often exist across lots of distinct roles in the
                | development life cycle. For example, someone identifies what is required whilst someone
                | else designs the solution, someone constructs a product whilst someone else proves it
                | meets the requirements etc.

              h2 Distinct Learning Advantage

              p
                | When it comes to learning something new, it seems to me that starters have a distinct
                | advantage. They relish the opportunity and approach it with enthusiasm, sleeves rolled
                | up and ready to jump in with both feet, itching to get hands-on. 

              p
                | Finishers tend to be much more cautious and reserved about learning something new, wondering
                | just how big a challenge they are about to take on. 

              h2 Different Expectations

              p
                | Starters don‚Äôt expect to understand everything. Neither are they afraid of leaving ‚Äúrough
                | edges‚Äù or doing something in an imperfect way, they know that they haven‚Äôt been that way
                | before and so can‚Äôt be expected to get everything totally right first time. In fact, they
                | believe it‚Äôs never really been their job to get things totally right ‚Äì that‚Äôs what finishers
                | are for. 

              p
                | Finishers want to understand every nook and cranny and are looking for the exact detail,
                | seeking perfection in what they do. They are frustrated by not yet fully understanding or
                | knowing how to achieve a thing and by being temporarily forced to enter the hunting grounds
                | of the starters. For them, things don‚Äôt always ‚Äújust click‚Äù like it seems to for the starters.

              h2 Fish Out Of Water

              p
                | Finishers soon become ‚Äúfish out of water‚Äù when left to their own devices to learn something
                | significant because unless the learning comes quickly and easily, finishers soon become
                | overwhelmed by a lack of success and their seemingly poor understanding and productivity.
                | They somehow think they should be ‚Äúflying the helicopter solo by the end of the first lesson‚Äù
                | which is never going to happen (aside from The Matrix)!

              h2 Different Approach Needed

              p
                | It strikes me that finishers need a much more gradual approach to learning, almost in
                | slow-motion compared to the starters, with lots of watching demonstrations, asking questions
                | and hand-holding when it comes to learning by hands-on doing stuff. 

              p
                | You could also think of it this way: while the starters are putting on the harnesses and
                | ready to do the bungee jump at the drop of a hat, the finishers are more than happy to just
                | sit back, watch and ask questions afterwards. Starters and finishers really are poles apart!

              h2 Change Agents And Perfectionists

              p
                | A finisher will always (albeit eventually) perfect a greater depth of knowledge and expertise
                | in a given subject compared to a starter but it‚Äôs the starters that get the ball rolling
                | ‚Äì they are the agents that bring in change to the benefit of all. They give the perfectionists
                | something to perfect, even if it sometimes means dragging them backwards through hedges to get there.

              p
                | In today‚Äôs world of IT, no one can avoid change. It‚Äôs a given that change is inevitable and
                | therefore unavoidable. Those organisations able to recognise and embrace change to gain competitive
                | advantage will most likely be those able to balance the juxtaposition of their starters (change
                | agents) and finishers (perfectionists) by enabling them to purse learning at their own pace and depth.

              p
                | Are you ready to jump? Or just watch.

              p
                | PS In truth, I‚Äôm a finisher. Hats off to the starters. No fear! üòä
