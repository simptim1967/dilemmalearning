              h2 Presentation First Outing

                | This Tuesday was the first formal outing of my ‚ÄúContinuous Learning Dilemma‚Äù presentation
                | and also my first Meetup event.

              p
                | The venue was The Old Joint Stock in the centre of Birmingham and I was lucky enough to get
                | a lift from colleagues both there and back. Sweet. Only had to carry my Lenovo
                | home-weight-lifting-kit a short distance and I managed to remember my rucksack too instead
                | of the usual chunky and heavy laptop bag.

              p
                | I was a bit nervous because my presentation could be perceived as telling people about a
                | problem they might not know they have yet. However, it was a good, all-round experience.
                | One I‚Äôd be happy to repeat.

              p
                | Around 60+ people of 115 registered for the event turned out in their own time after work
                | to attend. That‚Äôs enthusiasm to learn. Some were even prepared to stand as the room was full.
                | Free food and beer was at hand but I‚Äôm sure that wasn‚Äôt a factor. üòä

              p
                | Andy Burgin (@andyburgin), from Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, talked about DevOps Transformation
                | and was quite an act to follow. 30 minutes later it was all over. A few people were kind enough
                | to give me a thumbs-up when I asked how it went. I‚Äôm taking that as a green light to proceed
                | with further outings.

              h3 Unexpected Bonus

              p
                | Bumping into a former agile team member who recognised my name on the presenter list and
                | decided to come along was a bonus and it was good to catch up and hear about his successful
                | learning journey from Developer to Architect. I love to see potential in people realised.
                | Go Harshad!

              h3 Presentation Slide Deck

              p
                | For anyone who wishes to download "The Continuous Learning Dilemma" presentation slide deck
                | that I used, it can be found here:

              h2 The Value Of Social Learning

              p
                | As part of some research during my last blog post I came across the 
                a(href="https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/70-20-10-model/", title="the 70:20:10 model", target="_blank") the 70:20:10 model
                |  related to informal learning. This was news to me and really interesting. 

              p
                | The model basically says 70% of our learning comes from experience (hands-on), 20% from social
                | interactions and the remaining 10% from formal training. 
              p
                | Long story short, 90% of our learning
                | is done informally, outside of the classroom.       
                | This implies that Meetup events can potentially meet more of our learning needs than the classroom. Whoa!

              h2 What happened at the Meetup?

              p
                | I learnt some stuff, others did too. That‚Äôs what happened. Everyone was a winner.

              p
                | Andy Burgin (@andyburgin) described two patterns in detail that Sky use to innovate new products as well as proclaiming 
                | the virtues of the Spotify organisational approach of Squads and Tribes which they also employ.
              
              p
                | Paul Jacques (@psjacques) described organisational culture and the modern challenges of attracting 
                | and retaining talent. There was much food for thought here for those responsible for feeding the 
                | corporate talent machine. He made a good point by ending on the phrase "Think again."

              p
                | I got some more public speaking experience and some valuable feedback on my presentation style
                | from a fellow speaker which was much appreciated and will be taken to heart.
              
              p
                | I also gained some confidence that I have pitched my subject and material at the right level ‚Äì further
                | outings will tell. A Twitter comment from @rgee0 said the delivery ‚Äúfelt like counselling‚Äù but in a
                | positive way. (The first counselling session is always free. üòä)

              p
                | In the further conversations that followed the presentations I heard about the ‚ÄúDunning-Kruger Effect‚Äù,
                | a big ticket item for me
                | and now on my research stack, along with a few product names mentioned in the presentations to look up
                | that I‚Äôd not heard of before. 
              
              p
                | I‚Äôve started a habit of looking stuff up so I potentially don‚Äôt get caught out in
                | conversations with customers if I can help it. I write the names in my learning diary and then a
                | description when I eventually find out what they are. Doing this helps me move the detail into
                | longer term memory for better recall - well that's the theory anyway.
