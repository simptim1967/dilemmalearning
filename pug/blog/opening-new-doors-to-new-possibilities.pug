              h2 Recent Training

              p
                | This week I took a three-day training course on ‚ÄúArchitecting for AWS‚Äù. Even though
                | I‚Äôve been playing around with Cloud tech as a kind of background, slow-burn, learning
                | curve I jumped at the opportunity of a free place on a course and finally got some
                | official and formal AWS classroom training. It proved to be a helpful mix of theory
                | and hands-on practice in some pre-prepared lab scenarios.
              
              p
                | I enjoyed the experience and it was fun to hear what some of my colleagues on the
                | course had been getting up to putting the AWS technologies to work for different
                | customer accounts and projects. This was a big tick on my ToDo List. Yay! üòä

              p
                | This week I also finished off a few mandatory CBT modules (this time it was Cyber Security stuff)
                | that we get asked to do once in a while. I must admit these were certainly not as
                | interesting as the AWS training although they are important to our business and so
                | just as necessary. (They were a necessary tick on my ToDo List.)

              p
                | Needless to say, I learnt a lot this week.

              h2 Approximate Training

              p
                | Training about theory and the different technology choices available are just a
                | sample taste of the possibilities of how technologies might be combined and used
                | for constructing solutions.

              p
                | It‚Äôs necessary to know the detail behind the acronyms and an opportunity to get
                | hands-on can take you from ‚Äúdipping your toe in‚Äù, to getting ‚Äúknee deep‚Äù pretty
                | quickly but the actual SME level knowledge comes from going way past ‚Äúwhat it
                | says on the tin‚Äù to joining all of the dots together to build a fully operable
                | solution where each component technology is known intimately (including its
                | limitations and perhaps ‚Äúquirky‚Äù or exaggerated way of working).
                
              p
                | Not everything we get to pick up and use is necessarily fit for purpose or
                | truly production ready these days.

              h2 Possibilities And Opportunities

              p
                | To me, training is always about opening the doors to creative possibilities
                | and a great opportunity to ask relevant questions (of both instructors and
                | colleagues) but I don‚Äôt expect it to give me the deep subject knowledge that
                | comes only from long term exposure and the deliberate intent of making something
                | work as part of a solution.
                
              p
                | Deep knowledge often has a list of adjacent skills and knowledge that must
                | also be acquired in parallel.

              h2 Almost Production Ready

              p
                | Picking up and combining technologies is very quick and easy to do these days.
                | In fact, some would say it‚Äôs far too easy and almost misleading and that ‚Äúthe
                | devil is in the detail‚Äù. The drive to get something into live production can
                | often be tripped up by these ‚Äúsmall details‚Äù but I won‚Äôt argue with the approach
                | of getting something started quickly and then rapidly iterating through an
                | improvement lifecycle ‚Äì even if it means starting again downstream with a different
                | approach or different technologies.

              p
                | Learning technologies on the job can be fun but we never want to be in the
                | situation of saying ‚Äúif we‚Äôd known then what we know now, we‚Äôd never have done
                | it that way!‚Äù. This is were having the right mindset to approaching new technology
                | adoption comes in.

              h2 Every Project Is Different

              p
                | One of the things I like about my job is that it is both creative and challenging.
                | No two projects are alike and learning comes from every project. I‚Äôve lost count
                | of how many projects I‚Äôve done over the years and the array of tools, technologies
                | and techniques I‚Äôve used is vast. I‚Äôve sure learnt a lot from doing it.

              h2 Show Me ‚Äì Don‚Äôt Tell Me

              p
                | Experience has taught me that ‚Äúproving‚Äù is a big and necessary part of solution
                | development. It‚Äôs one thing to string things together, it‚Äôs another to make them
                | secure, performant, operational, reliable, available, usable, cost efficient etc.
                | It‚Äôs a whole team effort which takes a certain mindset to achieve.
              
              p
                | The mindset is in recognising that building serious solutions is a marathon, not
                | a sprint. It‚Äôs knowing that just because something claims to do something useful
                | doesn‚Äôt mean that it will do it well.

              h2 The Challenge Remains The Same

              p
                | To me, the challenge remains the same. Come up with a solution: make it work,
                | do it on time, do it well.
                
              p
                | What‚Äôs different these days is how many choices we have at the start and how
                | great the expectations and demands are that are placed on us by our customers.

              p
                | If it was easy, it probably wouldn‚Äôt be worth doing! üòä

              p
                | Thankfully, training is always opening new doors to new possibilities ‚Ä¶
