              h2 Walking The Line

              p
                | Attempting to walk in a straight line is a quick test for a drunk driver
                | whose lack of coordination soon betrays them.

              p
                | I'm a fan of burn-down charts. Every day on my current project we "walk
                | the line" charting our progress and knowing whether we are on track,
                | ahead or behind.

              p
                | Having the line permanently on display is a great reminder to stay on
                | track and is part of the transparency mature project teams exhibit.

              h2 A Compass On The Open Sea

              img.img-thumbnail.img-responsive(src='/images/lost-at-sea.jpg', alt='Lost At Sea', title='Lost At Sea')
              p
                | Out on the open sea the horizon looks the same in every direction. On a
                | cloudy day you may not even have the sun or stars as a point of reference.

              p
                | It would be foolish to set off without any means of knowing which direction
                | you are heading and whether or not you are making the progress you expect.
                | You might soon end up all adrift and lost at sea. 

              p  
                | Having tools that allow you to quickly find out whether or not you are on
                | track or off course is a great benefit. Such tools are highly valued by
                | mature project teams who gladly invest the effort in creating the necessary
                | data to support the tools in their revelation of truth so that they can 
                | course correct as necessary and keep the customer informed.  

              h2 Sooner Rather Than Later

              p
                | Tracking progress is an on-going activity. It isn't something to be left as an
                | occasional thing in case you find out you are significantly off course far too
                | late in a project to correct it. Frequent checking with occasional correction
                | is usually the order of the day.

              p
                | Teams that check their progress late in the day often find out they are behind
                | schedule at a time went they least want to hear it!

              h2 Not Rocket Science

              p
                | Progress calculations often don't look like rocket science, they are often easy
                | to compute.

              p
                | For example, if you have approximately 100 items to migrate over a 
                | 5 month period then you might expect to see 20 items migrated a month which
                | is approximately 5 items a week. Simple math and simple progress milestones.

              h2 Learning Projects

              p
                | Learning needs to be treated as a project in itself but often isn't.

              p
                | Just as we need to plan and track our progress on IT projects to make sure we are 
                | delivering value and staying on schedule and budget to keep both the customer
                | and our organisation happy, so we should plan and track our learning projects to make
                | sure we are achieving our desired learning outcomes.

              p
                | We set revenue and profit targets, so we should set learning targets too. 

              h2 Good Intentions 

              p
                | It is not enough to say something like "we need to embrace cloud technologies" if we are to compete 
                | in future markets. There has to be a project behind the intention if the outcome is to
                | be achieved. Otherwise, it's another example of where "failing to plan is planning to fail".

              h2 Learning Projects

              p
                | Learning projects based on a strategic intention take into account the different needs and roles
                | of people in an organisation.

              p  
                | Some people will need hands-on skills backed by support from SMEs. Others will need a thorough
                | high level understanding whilst some will need just a basic understanding.

              p
                | Learning needs to be geared so that all of the right people achieve their learning to the
                | appropriate level at
                | the right time. This can feel counter-intuitive as SMEs take time to grow and training courses
                | are usually not enough to equip hands-on practitioners. Sales personnel and architects are often closer 
                | and earlier to emerging customer expectations.

              h2 Learning Metrics

              p
                | How exactly do you identify and measure progress metrics for learning?
                | This is part of 
                a(href="the-continuous-learning-dilemma.html#corporatedilemma", title="The Corporate Learning Dilemma") the corporate learning dilemma
                |  and something to be taken seriously if strategic objectives are to be achieved 
                | rather than relegated to good intentions at best.

              p
                | Some of the metrics you might consider as part of your learning project could include
                | statistics related to:
                ul
                  li Training courses
                  li Conferences
                  li Certifications
                  li On-line training
                  li Technical briefings
                  li Personal development objectives
                  li Projects 
                  li Bids

              p
                | The good news is that there are tools to help with this problem such as 
                a(href="https://www.pluralsight.com", title="Pluralsight", target="_blank") Pluralsight
                |  for example.

              p
                | Perhaps the most serious metric you can consider is how many learning projects you are running. ðŸ˜Š
