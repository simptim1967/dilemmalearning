                | If you don‚Äôt have the luxury of a secret hideaway or a private office with a closed door and ‚ÄúDo Not
                | Disturb‚Äù sign (or some other agreed office convention) then the magic device that
                | you need is a pair of headphones ‚Äì hopefully a set that doesn‚Äôt make you look like
                | an air traffic controller.

                | Headphones allow you to ‚Äúkill two birds with one stone‚Äù, to coin an English phrase.
                | By wearing a pair of headphones you can avoid both everyday distractions and occasional
                | unwanted interruptions from people.

                | I avoid occasional interruptions from people by pretending to be on a call. I even move
                | the microphone on my headset into place and pretend to speak. People see that you are ‚Äúbusy‚Äù and walk
                | away. Sweet!

                | I tried the headphones trick for a while without actually listening to anything but
                | realised that I was still breaking my concentration with the distractions of tuning into
                | the various conversations of colleagues happening nearby. That‚Äôs really useful when 
                | you‚Äôre co-located with your dev team but not so good if you are hiding away in the
                | hope of getting something done.

              p
                | I found some background piano and guitar music on YouTube. At time of writing it had
                | 21,975,479 views. (Most of those are mine. üòä) It stops me tuning into conversations
                | but doesn‚Äôt stop me working. I guess favourite music with lyrics might start me singing
                | ‚Äì not good for anyone‚Äôs productivity and more likely to get something thrown at me or
                | cause it to start it raining.
