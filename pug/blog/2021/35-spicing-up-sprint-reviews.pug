              hr.featurette-divider

              h2 Finishing Well 

              p
                | After all of the hard work that the team has put into delivering the next product increment it's 
                | important to keep up the good work and finish well.

              p 
                | The Sprint Review, or "Sprint Demo" as we usually refer to it, will be the team's opportunity to demonstrate
                | everything they've accomplished this sprint
                | so that the Product Owner and their fellow stakeholders can assess the outcome and start to collaborate on 
                | what to do next.

              p 
                | Hopefully it will be a time to celebrate success and hand out a few accolades and not a time to hang our heads 
                | in shame after failing to deliver on our commitments or to customer expectations.

              p 
                | In order to finish well the team still has some work to do. 

              h2 Golden Opportunity

              p 
                | We consider all time with the customer to be "golden".

              p
                | Not only is it an important opportunity to demonstrate 
                | to the customer that they are getting value for money and that you are making good progress towards their product and
                | project goals
                | but it is also a time to ask questions and listen to their needs, priorities, challenges and concerns. 

              p 
                | It's a good idea to designate a "Scribe" to capture matters
                | that arise during the meeting as well as any feedback given by the Product Owner or stakeholders - especially
                | if there is an agreed action, unanswered question or any contradiction or ambiguity. The whole team should 
                | share this responsibility throughout the meeting to help ensure the Scribe doesn't get swamped and miss something.

              p
                | Note: Recording on-line meetings can help but this may not always be possible.

              h2 Understanding And Adjusting To Your Your Audience 

              p 
                | Recognise that not everyone in your audience may be technical, or have a full grasp of the requirements that 
                | you have lived and breathed for the last sprint. Some may also be unaware of the full functionality
                | of the product you are building or the systems that interface with it.
                
              p  
                | Your demonstration needs to be mostly non-technical and be easy to follow and understand.
                | You should aim to 
                | provide proof of understanding requirements and demonstrate the quality of what you built.

              p 
                | If you are demonstrating to a remote audience then you won't easily be able to tell who is paying attention 
                | or anyone who is looking confused. In such situations it's good to occasionally ask and check that everything is
                | making sense.

              h2 Sprint Review Preparation 

              p 
                | Preparation for the Sprint Review is essential and should feature in Sprint Planning accordingly.
                | The greater the importance, the greater the level of planning and preparation.

              p 
                | Mixing it up in terms of the people involved can also help although it may take some people out of their 
                | comfort zone until they get used to it. We insist each team demonstrates specifically what they built but 
                | leave it to the teams themselves to decide who exactly will do that.

              p 
                | Having a script helps: 
                ul 
                  li Understand the running order.
                  li Know who is doing what (Host, Scribe, feature X, feature Y ...).
                  li Ensure nothing gets missed.
                  li Understand likely timings.

              p 
                | Again, depending on the importance, you may wish to rehearse your demonstrations.

              h2 Turning Something Dull Into Something Shiny 

              p 
                | Sometimes functionality is just plain dull and needs to be mode more interesting to demonstrate.
                | On some occasions it may also be quite challenging to demonstrate features, especially when there are no 
                | user interface aspects to the functionality or when error situations have to be contrived.

              p 
                | Creating supporting content can help: 
                ul 
                  li Provide a pre-amble explanation of each feature prior to demonstrating it.
                  li Explain the specific test scenario and data values used.
                  li Add to the fun and make it more interesting or thought provoking.  

              p 
                | Using a test harness can help:
                ul 
                  li Add a visual element to non-visual features. 
                  li Make it easy to customise your test scenarios during a demonstration.

              p 
                | We introduced a test harness to demonstrate our tax calculations to make it easier for the customer 
                | to see calculation inputs and outputs instead of squinting at raw JSON data structures. This also enabled us 
                | to prepare different scenarios in advance that could then be rapidly called up during the review.

              h2 Presenting The Finished Work

              p 
                | The aim is to provide a seamless, ordered demonstration of everything that has been built during the 
                | sprint that will be a positive experience for all involved. Having a designated meeting host can help
                | the meeting run smoothly and keep timings on track.

              p
                | However, things don't always go to plan, especially in remote demonstrations and you may
                | need to have some kind of contingency plan and be flexible in the order of presentation to enable recovery
                | from unexpected problems.

              p  
                | If you know that you have some non-technical participants and someone from your team rattles out a whole load of 
                | techno-babble then you may want to chip in and explain what was just said to ensure you don't lose any of your 
                | audience along the way. 

              p 
                | Make sure any questions that arise are suitably answered and that any agreed follow-up actions are
                | recorded as necessary.

              p 
                | Beware going off-piste during a demonstration unless the customer encourages you to do so.
                | You may win a friend (ðŸ˜Š) or gain a bug report (ðŸ˜’). Whatever you do, don't de-rail the meeting!
                
              h2 Provoking Feedback And Knowledge Exchange

              p 
                | Teams thrive on feedback so your sprint reviews should be provocative. Don't be afraid to directly 
                | ask for feedback and be prepared to receive negative feedback.

              p 
                | Encourage positive feedback from the customer by delivering positive feedback and accolades of your own. 
                | Sprint reviews are a great opportunity to honour people who have done great work during the sprint.

              p 
                | Sprint reviews are not just about feedback, they are also an opportunity to share knowledge so that
                | both the team and customer can engage to exchange valuable knowledge.

              h2 Variety 

              p 
                | However you go about spicing up your sprint reviews, remember that variety is the spice of life!

              h2 Agile Health Check - Sprint Review 

              p 
                | Why not take the opportunity to give your Sprint Reviews an Agile health check?
