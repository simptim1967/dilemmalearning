              h2 The Continuous Learning Dilemma - It's Real!
              p
                | Last week I described ‚ÄúThe Continuous Learning Dilemma‚Äù that I believe all of us as IT people
                | and organisations are facing. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a small challenge, neither do I believe it‚Äôs
                | going away any time soon. It‚Äôs a challenge we all must face and overcome if we are to be
                | successful as individuals, teams and organisations.

              p
                | Some people would say it‚Äôs not so much a challenge as an opportunity!
                | If IT was ‚Äúeasy‚Äù anybody could do it. In reality it's an infinite game i.e. we never really win,
                | we just aim to stay playing!
              
              p
                | At Capgemini we welcome this challenge as an opportunity to demonstrate our breadth of knowledge
                | and technical dexterity.

              h3 Out Of My Comfort Zone

              p
                | In my role as Capabilities Lead within the Digital Delivery Group (DDG) a couple of things take
                | me out of my comfort zone. One is building my people network, the other is the battle for hearts
                | and minds. These aren‚Äôt strengths for me but I‚Äôm happy to learn as well as ride on the coat-tails
                | of others, especially when they offer to extend my network into the wider Capgemini (200K+
                | people) and beyond.

              h3 Collaboration Required

              p
                | None of the challenges we take on at Capgemini can ever be considered small enough for just one
                | person to deal with and so team effort and collaboration with others is a must. The challenge of
                | the continuous learning dilemma is no different ‚Äì in fact it‚Äôs going to take the brains of the
                | whole IT industry (and then some) to solve this one! Fortunately, collaborative working is a
                | means of putting your own limitations behind you and playing to your strengths and those of others.

              h3 Choosing An Approach

              p
                img#mugshot.img-thumbnail.img-responsive(src='../images/plates-spinning.jpg', alt='Spinning Plates', title='Spinning Plates')
                | The approach to this challenge must be agile (in order to get feedback fast, learn and adapt)
                | and multi-threaded because success will be through multiple people and ideas running in parallel.
                | The approach also has to generate metrics that will help us. It will be like ‚Äúspinning plates‚Äù.
                | Effort will be needed to keep plates spinning and to spin up new ones. Some plates will
                | inevitably get broken along the way ‚Äì maybe we won‚Äôt count those, just learn from them.

              p
                | I know that I can‚Äôt expect to do this role well without working with and through a network of
                | people and that I also need to ‚Äútake people with me‚Äù along the way. (This means finding people
                | willing to keep plates spinning for me.)

              p
                | My background thread is ‚ÄúContinuous Research‚Äù where I periodically research (usually daily for
                | a few minutes making notes of keywords and useful links) in order to learn from the best around
                | the world. Thankyou Internet.

              h3 The Battle For Hearts and Minds

              p
                | Winning hearts and minds is just plain hard to me. The necessity and benefits of making learning
                | part of the day job seem obvious to me and I can‚Äôt always understand why others don‚Äôt see that.

              p
                | Selling is clearly a skill in it‚Äôs own right. I swear that if there were no people involved,
                | doing IT would be a doddle!

              p
                | It took me a while to learn and accept that people are motivated by different priorities and so
                | the same ‚Äúsales pitch‚Äù isn‚Äôt appropriate for all customers. For managers it is often about
                | hitting budgets and deadlines ahead of anything else to please our customers (and our accountants)
                | which doesn‚Äôt always align with the company mantra ‚ÄúPeople matter, results count‚Äù. Fortunately not
                | everyone is short-sighted. (I‚Äôm literally long-sighted. üòä)

              h2 The Continuous Learning Spectrum

              h2 The Continuous Learning Spectrum - Theory or Reality?

              p
                | If the above spectrum is true, the questions that immediately arise include what percentage of people
                | currently fit into each category and how can we move the sliders to shift people between categories to
                | achieve the optimal numbers we desire? Categorisation is only a theory until you have a means of
                | applying it to generate metrics. (We‚Äôll look deeper into this in a future post.)

              h3 1)	The Trail Blazers

              p
                | Some people (Google call them ‚Äúlearning animals‚Äù) are already there with continuous learning
                | and they‚Äôre so busy loving learning new stuff in new ways and applying it in their work that
                | they don‚Äôt even look backwards to see the others they‚Äôve left behind! I need to throw a rope
                | around these guys and work out how to get them dragging others with them.

              p
                | These people are often less in number and in high demand. They are candidates for coaching,
                | knowledge sharing and involvement in community activities if they are not already doing so.
                | These are some of the people we‚Äôd really like to clone. (Ultimately we‚Äôd like everyone in
                | this category ‚Äì job done.)

              h3 2)	The Well-Intentioned Majority

              p
                | Most people relate reasonably well to the necessity to learn new skills and are
                | well-intentioned about learning. However, many suffer from sub-optimal time management skills
                | coupled with a strong desire (and project pressure) to delight the customer which both
                | inevitably impact commitment to learning. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not saying that learning is
                | more important than delighting customers but what I am saying is that learning is essential
                | to delighting customers and so getting the balance right in terms of how we manage our time
                | is extremely important.

              p
                | These guys need direction as well as help managing their time and support and encouragement
                | from managers for learning.

              h3 3)	The Partially Convinced

              p
                | Here the battle for hearts and minds is still being fought or yet to be fought. The ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs
                | in it for me?‚Äù question has not been suitably answered. Here the learning approach is a
                | little ‚Äúad hoc‚Äù and more a response to pressure. New ways of learning attract minimal levels
                | of interest unless provoked. Another form of motivation is required here.

              h3 4)	The Not Convinced

              p
                | Here the battle for hearts and minds has been lost. The value-proposition answer to the
                | ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in it for me?‚Äù question did not align at all with the motivations / priorities of
                | these people. Continuous learning is perceived to be an anti-pattern that may hinder
                | delivering on time and to budget and is simply not necessary for personal success right
                | now. Only leadership direction can change this position.

              h3 5) The Minimalist Minority

              p
                | Some will say that people who don‚Äôt want to learn new things or who resist change
                | shouldn‚Äôt be working in the IT industry where change is constant. That‚Äôs not a helpful
                | viewpoint when such people are talented and performing significant roles that they enjoy
                | but which dominate their time ‚Äì including their learning time. They may also be generating
                | significant revenue for the business in doing so. (Don‚Äôt you just love this dilemma?!)

              p
                | There is also a minority who resist change or are apathetic. Management intervention is
                | required here. (Such people leave me wondering if even dynamite would make a difference!
                | üòä However, we are not planning on leaving anyone behind.)

              h2 Building People

                | In any large organisation you can sometimes feel like a small wheel with a number in a big
                | machine where managing your career is your problem. However, my role as DDG Capabilities

                | At Capgemini we like people to be ‚ÄúT-shaped‚Äù in terms of their knowledge and skills i.e.

                | people to have their own areas of interest and to know what they want to be ‚Äúfamous‚Äù for.

              h3 "Pi-Shaped" People

              p
                | I recently saw a description of "Pi-shaped (&pi;)" people who had "two deep skills" as opposed
                | to the "one very deep skill" of "T-shaped" people. This seems unrealistic to me as it's so rare
                | for people to have or need just one or two deep skills when most skills have many closely 
                | related (adjacent) skills so there is rarely a single learning curve.
                | I'm also not really able to grasp the difference between "deep" and "very deep" skills.
