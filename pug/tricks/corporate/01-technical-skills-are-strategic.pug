              hr.featurette-divider

              h2 Every Company Is Now A "Tech Company"

              p
                | Today, almost every organisation uses technology to drive its business.
                | Technical skills are now recognised as strategic in value and key to future success.
                | What differentiates companies is their business agility based on their ability to
                | learn and embrace new skills in order to innovate.

              h2 Skills Half-Life

              p
                | Many skills are short-lived or highly volatile with an estimated half-life of two years. This means that employees
                | will no sooner have learned and mastered a skill then they will be forced to learn a new one or update their knowledge. 

              h2 The Growing Digital Skills Gap

              p
                | In the past it was far easier to hire in new talent to plug organisational skills gaps but the rate
                | of change has led to a digital skills shortage forcing organisations to invest and grow their own talent.
                | Internal talent growth requires continued commitment to learning over a long period of time and
                | many organisations are finding themselves with a skills deficit.

              h2 Skills Projects

              p
                | Skills projects are projects in their own right and therefore deserve to be treated as such. Without a
                | a clear strategy and review milestones, Skills Projects are unlikely to deliver. You can't rely on the
                | mentality that "if we announce it, it will happen". Instead you must plan and manage the journey and
                | course correct from time to time as necessary. This must happen at all levels within the organisation.

              h2 No Replacement For Lack Of Strategy

              p
                | It is essential for an organisation to determine and communicate it's strategy if skills acquisition
                | is to be linked to and driven by business goals. This is true regardless of how long term the strategy is.
                | It must also be possible to measure progress and achievements along the way if course corrections
                | are to be identified and made en route.

              p
                | Having a strategy is a great way of gaining buy-in from your staff to accommodate the changes necessary
                | to eventually arrive at your chosen destination. Discussing progress along the journey will help
                | to maintain momentum before the opportunity finally arises to celebrate success.
