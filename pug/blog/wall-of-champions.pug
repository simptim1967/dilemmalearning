              h2 Ulterior Motive

              p
                | Let me start by being totally honest. The "Wall Of Champions" initiative started out with
                | an ulterior motive. It's
                | goal was to help identify people who "knew stuff" so that we could pounce on them
                | and force them to share their knowledge at a technical community event. Subtle huh? ðŸ˜Š
              
              p
                | The reason for this subtle approach was that technical communities without content (i.e. speakers)
                | don't really work or make it easy to build people so we needed a way to find speakers to get
                | our targeted technical communities rolling.

              p
                | Let me explain how we went about this initiative, how it worked out and where it finally landed.

              h2 The Three Lists: Tools, Techniques and Technologies

              p
                | To start the ball rolling we created three lists. One for "Tools" (e.g. Jira) and the others for
                | "Techniques" (e.g. Scrum) and "Technologies" (e.g. HTML) - all excluding version numbers. We then
                | asked people to help us populate and review the lists and add their name against any item
                | if they felt themselves to be an expert on that topic. 

              p
                | We also sought to assign a status for each department within the Digital Delivery
                | Group (DDG) against each tool / technique / technology as to whether an item was either not used,
                | in use, starting use or deliberately not used or stopping use by that department.

              p
                | We also flagged items as "Top Skills" for the items that had been identified as part of our
                | strategy at the start of the year as skills we wanted to grow in order for our business 
                | to meet growing customer demands and emerging markets.

              p
                | Just imagine ... at the end of this we would know that status of all the tools, techniques and
                | technologies used across the whole DDG and who the experts are for each of them. What's not to like!
              
              h2 A Bridge Too Far

              p
                | Many things start out with good intentions (or ulterior motives) but end up failing because they
                | are asking too much, unrealistic or simply impractical. We hit all three of these and so the
                | initiative started to fizzle out before it really got started. You could even hear people quietly
                | saying "good luck with that" as they side-stepped the initiative.

              P
                | Expecting to populate and maintain our three lists was simply unrealistic.ðŸ˜’

              p
                | I wasn't overly concerned about the failed initiative as there wasn't much I could do about it.
                | I looked at it as one of the many plates that I was spinning knowing that some would break and 
                | therefore this must just be one of them.

              h2 The Quest For Community Speakers

              p
                | The most effective way I have found of helping technical communities to find speakers is
                | to operate a simple hierarchy.

              p
                | In my case, I work with community owners and their deputies. I work across the communities to
                | encourage each of them to build up a backlog of ideas for future meetings whilst arranging short term
                | events and seeking to achieve our agreed community goals. 
              p
                | In turn, each community owner and their deputy works with their group of community leaders 
                | (usually 4) to plan
                | and drive meetings. They are the ones who identify the speakers although 
                | I also approach individuals directly myself and
                | ask them to speak at events.
                | Some speakers take more encouraging than others - especially busy "goto" people.


              p
                | Once communities become well established they pretty much drive themselves in terms of people
                | wanting to present.
                
              h2 Wall Of Champions Re-born

              p
                | The goal of technical communities "building people" in a tangible way proved to be the saving
                | grace for the "Wall Of Champions" concept.

              p
                | As we ran study squads to allow people to study together for exam certifications we spotted an
                | opportunity to publicly recognise success for people achieving certifications (over and above
                | our standard reward and recognition systems). 

              p
                | Our "Top Skillz" initiative (yes that's how it's spelled after re-branding) asked communities to list courses
                | on community team sites that people could take to further their skills. Some team sites went on to
                | provide links to various other resources too, including sample exams for certifications. 

              p
                | As a result of certification success, we decided to add a "Wall Of Champions" page to each
                | community team site. This lists the certifications sought by the community along with a list of names of those
                | who have attained them (in alphabetical order to show no bias).

              p
                | The "Wall Of Champions" concept was thus successfully re-born and now serves to celebrate the success
                | of certified individuals and demonstrate the tangible success of our communities to build 
                | people. This also acts as a motivation to others to get their name added to the Wall Of
                | Champions and also satisfies the ulterior motive of identifying a list of SMEs to potentially
                | speak at future community events. Yay! ðŸ˜Š
