              p
                | Earlier this month I described the intention to implement ‚Äúpage like‚Äù functionality for
                | DilemmaLearning.com and gave a progress update the following week. The former sparkle in
                | my eye has now been achieved (yay!) so I want to share some of the highs and lows and
                | what I learned from doing this.

              p
                | I‚Äôd decided to use a MySQL database (hosted by AWS RDS) to store the page like data and
                | that this would be read and updated directly from the client-side browser using JavaScript
                | to make API calls to back-end AWS Lambda functions (NodeJS fronted by AWS API Gateway). This was
                | all new stuff to me and an irresistible opportunity to delve into the technologies and
                | learn by doing.

              p
                | Forgive all the specific technologies named. This article is about what I learned from
                | the experience and really not at all about the actual technologies. They are named
                | purely for context.

              h2 Timeless Skills

              p
                | Debugging is a timeless skill and well worth any investment you make in learning how
                | to do it well.

              p
                | There were several situations where a lack of old-fashioned ‚Äúpolicing‚Äù (code reviews,
                | asserts, error handling code and debug info logging) led to far too much wasted time and ‚Äúwild goose
                | chases‚Äù, including blaming AWS for bugs in their Lambda proxy integration code. (Sorry
                | AWS, but even the code I cut and paste is almost always perfect like the rest of my
                | code. üòä)

              p
                | For example, following the best practice of putting configuration into environment
                | variables caused me to
                | make a spelling mistake in the name of the environment variable used to hold
                | the RDS database user password. This meant the Lambda function would never be able
                | to connect successfully to the database to do anything. It took me ages to find that
                | simple typo bug. Doh!

                img.img-thumbnail(src="/images/pointing-right.svg" width="30" height="30")

                b
                  u
                   | Lesson:
                |  Assert your environment variables aren't null. (Lots of people make environment typos.)

              p
                | However, my code wasn‚Äôt even getting that far due to a network problem where Lambda
                | couldn‚Äôt talk to my RDS instance. When I reviewed my network setup and permissions policies (copied of
                | course) they were totally wrong (pointing at logs in a region my code wasn‚Äôt running in and granting
                | access to a Dynamo database that I wasn‚Äôt using). 

              p
                | I would have found the bugs much sooner if I‚Äôd known which logs to look in on AWS and
                | the monitoring facilities available but this was all new territory and I hadn‚Äôt taken
                | any time to find out or ask anyone about what was available or where to look.

                   | Lesson:
                |  Always get expert help to review your network setup and permissions.

              p
                | In my opinion, the AWS console encourages newbies like me into bad habits (like hack and
                | slash Lambda coding and manual configuration practices). I think I found that out the hard
                | way when I tried to fix a CORS problem and ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù deleted an API call from my API
                | Gateway shortly after go live. Ouch!

                   | Lesson:
                |  Stick to your favourite code editor and write robust code with automated deployment
                | from your source repo and iterate rapidly.

                b
                  u
                   | Lesson:
                |  Never do anything manually in the cloud!
                | (Using tools like CloudFormation will enable you
                | to rapidly create and re-create AWS resources through automation.)

              h2 Early Learning

              p
                | As ‚Äúearly learners‚Äù we often find ourselves cutting and pasting example code or following
                | instructions verbatim from others. This is all part of the learning by doing journey when
                | unaccompanied. 

              p
                | It won‚Äôt surprise you to know that not everything we stumble across on the internet is best of
                | breed (or even working) code and it‚Äôs even more frustrating when the instructions you follow turn
                | out to be out of date or wrong. (I now regularly ignore cloud articles more than a year old.)

              h2 Gung Ho With Mis-Guided Trust

              img.mugshot.img-thumbnail.img-responsive(src='../images/warning-sign.svg', alt='Warning Sign', title='Warning Sign', width="120" height="120")

              p
                | We are more prone than ever to trust and use the first thing we find when we encounter a significant
                | lack of understanding in what we are doing. Knowing we do that should really trigger some kind of
                | warning or fear about what we are about to do! 

              p
                | I‚Äôm just experimenting with technology building a blog site ‚Äì pretty harmless ‚Äì but someone else
                | might be using the same approach to re-work the code for an aircraft or a nuclear reactor etc. Whoa!

                  u
                   | Lesson:
                |  Admit it to yourself and be wary of falling into the trap of thinking that your short term exposure
                | and success has made you an expert at what you are doing. (It hasn‚Äôt. Not yet anyway.)

              h2 Not Always Expert Help

              p
                | I admit I did my share of cut and paste and following tutorials blindly as part of this work ‚Äì
                | some of it from highly esteemed websites known for helping people get answers to their problems
                | or for helping people get started with web technologies. 

              p
                | Some of the sample code I copied worked the first time but subsequent executions failed repeatably
                | because the code was poorly written and didn‚Äôt manage connection closure properly.

              .alert.alert-info(role="alert")

                b
                  u
                   | Lesson:
                |  Websites are often just quick-starts for your journey and are not handing you the
                | actual solution so remember that you cut and paste and follow their advice at your peril.

              h2 Others Sharing The Same Pain Does Not Help

              p
                | Along the way I noticed lots of people encountering the same problems as me who were presumably
                | making the same mistakes as me and possibly even using the same code snippets, tutorials and
                | articles for guidance after typing the same search phrases into their search engine as me. 

              p
                | I rarely go beyond the first page of search results before trying a different search and like
                | most people I pride myself in always knowing the best keywords to include in my searches ‚Äì yeah right!

              .alert.alert-info(role="alert")

                b
                  u
                   | Lesson:
                |  Seeing lots of similarly worded problems with no answers is often a clue that you may be
                | barking up the wrong tree or heading down a blind alley.  

              h2 Blind Alleys And Rabbit Holes

              p
                | Problem situations are notorious for taking us down blind alleys (some people call them ‚Äúrabbit
                | holes‚Äù these days) where we waste a lot of time trying to solve one problem after another because
                | we should never have gone there in the first place. 

              p
                | That‚Äôs often what happens when you cut and paste ‚Äúamateur code‚Äù when trying to short-cut a learning
                | curve. It happened to me with some NodeJS asynchronous JavaScript. Luckily (and thankfully) I found
                | a better library of sample code.

                |  Realise when you have gone down a blind alley (or are about to) and turn back.

              h2 Don‚Äôt Follow A Lost Sheep

              p
                | I stumbled across an article where someone described in great detail how they and their team spent
                | two weeks to not get something working and eventually blamed it on a bug in someone else‚Äôs library.
                | Wow! I‚Äôd rather find a solution myself and wouldn‚Äôt want to wait anywhere near two weeks to find it.
                | Two days would even be too long. Two hours would kind of be okay. üòä 

              p
                | They say ‚Äúa problem shared is a
                | problem halved‚Äù. That‚Äôs often true but it‚Äôs always true if you go to an expert!

                  u
                   | Lesson:
                |  If you find yourself searching over and over for different articles to find a solution to
                | your problem then stop, go find someone else (preferably a SME) and get some expert help! Keep looking
                | until you find someone who can actually help (not just willing).

              h2 The Map Is Not The Terrain

              p
                | Component testing boosts your confidence but it‚Äôs not a replacement for a full end-to-end test.
                | I encountered situations where my Lambda functions worked perfectly in the AWS console hitting the
                | ‚ÄúTest‚Äù button for the few test cases I defined but then my full end-to-end tests from the browser
                | would fail miserably.

                |  Having asserts, error handling and debug info logging in place for every step of the journey from the
