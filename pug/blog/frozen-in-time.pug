              h2 Change Demands Change

              p
                | In these times of "
                a(href="the-continuous-learning-dilemma.html#permanentchange", title="Permanent Change") permanent change
                | " in which we live we must recognise that change demands
                | change.
              
              p
                | Whilst anyone could be forgiven for freezing in a moment of panic (perhaps until the adrenaline
                | kicks in) no organisation can afford to ignore or resist change or be caught out by allowing 
                a(href="the-continuous-learning-dilemma.html#corporatedilemma", title="The Corporate Learning Dilemma") the corporate learning dilemma
                |  to turn into a fatal hesitation.

              p
                | Are you still using the same tools, techniques and technologies?
                | The same business processes and procedures?
                | Is your organisation frozen in time in a state of business rigidity?
                | Or are you experiencing and embracing change?

              h2 Change Shows No Mercy

              p
                | One thing is clear, those who do not embrace change will be swept away by it.
                | Nothing lasts forever and change shows no mercy. 
                | Failure to change inevitably
                | leads to extinction unless we bow to the demands of change and meet them head on, however difficult
                | that might be.

              h2 The Land That Time Forgot

              p
                | We all interact with different organisations as part of our everyday lives but sometimes when dealing
                | with them I can't help but wonder if electricity has yet to be invented for some of them! Are
                | they sharpening their quills before they write my request onto parchment to be delivered by hand to
                | an already overflowing in-tray? 

              p
                | This might go some way to explaining why I'm forced to telephone, wait ages, authenticate multiple times,
                | speak to someone who has
                | no knowledge of my previous interactions (or my decades of loyalty) before telling me it will take several 
                | weeks to action my request.

              p
                | Why would I ever go there again? Glaciers move quicker! Why don't I just switch my custom and leave such
                | organisations in the land that time forgot? (It has been known to happen! ðŸ˜Š)  

              h2 Same Old Same Old

              p
                | How organisations end up in the land that time forgot is simple - they assume that what made them successful
                | in the past will continue to make them successful in the future. You can just imagine them saying "we are making
                | good money doing this so if it ain't broke, don't fix it". The result is that "same old same old" prevails
                | and the big freeze sets in until the mighty oak begins to topple.

              p
                | Often our biggest competitor is our current way of working and our reluctance to change it. Some people
                | have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the future before they'll admit it's better! Others act like
                | their feet are set in concrete and refuse to budge - these are the change resistors. Either way, time marches on.

              p
                | (By the way, I love it when a change resistor becomes an advocate for change. I quietly smile at their change of heart
                | and force myself never to mention the U-turn they took. ðŸ˜Š)

              h2 What Really Motivates Us

              p
                | Most people want to come to work with a sense of purpose and leave with a sense of achievement. They want to
                | feel part of a shared goal and good about their work and workplace. They want interesting and challenging work
                | and recognition for doing a good job.
                
              p
                | It's actually surprising what really motivates
                | people and there's an interesting 
                a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc", title="What Really Motivates Us", target="_blank") animated video on a talk by Dan Pink
                |  on the subject.

              h2 New Age Managers

              p
                | Imagine a herd of new age managers, sweeping across the open plan, who are not driven solely by financial targets,
                | not in competition, not clambering over each other in a fight to get to the top but instead lovers of teamwork and
                | seeing their staff achieve their full potential.

              p
                | People who make time to listen to problems, work related or not. People who know that their
                | own success directly relates to the well being and capabilities of their staff and will be boosted
                | by their personal investment in people to build relationship and trust.

              p
                | Hey, stop imagining, the new age starts with you.

              h2 Turn Up The Heat

              p
                | The only way to avoid the big freeze is to turn up the heat by embracing the demands of change.

              p
                | It means looking at your business and the market place, listening to your customers, taking
                | the odd risk, experimenting with different tools, technologies and techniques, making time
                | for people and learning. 

              p
                | Above all, it means each of us avoiding
                | those comfortable ruts of "same old same old" and ushering in "change", one step at a time.
