                | Hi, my name is Tim Simpson. 
                | I’m a Senior Solution Architect within the Architecture Practice at Capgemini UK working mainly on the HMRC account 
                | which is Capgemini’s largest UK account.

              p 
                | I’ve worked on the account for many years and am currently assigned 
                | to the Digital Delivery Group (DDG) which has over 800 people in offices at multiple locations across the UK. 
                | It’s a very busy and exciting place to work! 

              p 
                | The DDG works concurrently on many projects for many different customers (not just HMRC) both in the Public
                | and Private sectors. We and our customers use virtually every tool, technology and technique you can think 
                | of somewhere along the way. Almost all of the projects we undertake are agile projects which may vary in 
                | duration from weeks, often months to sometimes years. The projects are almost always challenging whether that 
                | be due to complexity, scale, timescales, risk or all of these.
              
              p
                | I’m still convinced (after 3 decades in the IT industry including some time running my own software company)
                | that Architecture is the best discipline if you want to see every aspect of the development life cycle. It’s
                | a “go anywhere” pass!

              p
                | I’m also convinced that “building products” is way easier than “doing projects” (although both are great fun).
                | I’ve never seen much forgiveness in the aggressive “fixed price, fixed functionality and fixed deadline world
                | of projects” where you never get to do the same project twice. (Agile didn’t change much of that in the “large
                | projects” world.)

              p
                | I’m a reluctant blogger but several colleagues encouraged me to share the journey for the role I was offered
                | and took up over a year ago to spend 50% of my time as the “DDG Capabilities Lead”.

              p
                | The Capabilities Lead role basically involves driving the people within the DDG (all 750+ of them) to
                | continually enhance and learn new skills as well as share their knowledge so that as a business we can embrace
                | the ever-changing demands of our customers and win new business in emerging markets whilst remaining highly
                | capable and competitive.

              p
                | So how exactly do you go about doing that?! Where on earth do you start?! 

              p
                | ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

              p
                | The biggest problem for me is the problem that the IT industry has always faced, namely 
                a(href="the-continuous-learning-dilemma.html", title="The Continuous Learning Dilemma") “The Continuous Learning Dilemma”
                | . (More to follow on that in the next post.)

              p
                | Fortunately, I work with some really clever people who are never short of advice (or opinions) and because
                | Capgemini employs over 230,000 (and growing!) people across the globe I’m not alone in attacking this problem. There’s
                | also a host of business partners to call upon.
