              h1 A Time of Reflection
              hr.featurette-divider

              h2 H2 Is Here Already!
              p
                | At the start of this week I attended a DDG Information Cascade to discuss how we'd done as a department
                | in the first half of this year. It proved highly informative and motivational as always but what really
                | struck me was that H2 is here already! They say "Time flies when you're having fun" so I must be
                | having a lot of fun - which actually I am. ðŸ˜Š
                
              p  
                | My work as an architect is as varied and challenging as ever
                | and my role as Capabilities Lead is equally challenging and interesting. I'm reminded each day that
                | I work with some great people (very clever, very talented). What's not to like?
              
              p
                | But where did the last six months go?

              h2 Time To Stop For A Moment And Reflect

              p
                | I'm into Agile, so like any agile practitioner, I'm used to retrospective analysis and now would seem
                | a good time to stop for a moment to reflect and identify opportunities to improve and / or course-correct.

              p
                | My way of working makes it easy for me to know what I've been doing, it has traceability baked in.
                | Whether it's via my ToDo List "Done" items, my notebook pages of weekly work items or the list of
                | achievements in my personal development plan, it's all there and I'm usually surprised by how much I've
                | done and achieved.

              h2 Reflection Time

              p
                | So, have I achieved what I wanted to achieve so far this year? Do I need to make any changes? How is
                | the personal development plan going in terms of achievements? What about project work?
              
              h3 Project Work

              P
                | Project architecture work has gone well with successful project deliveries. There were lots of challenges
                | and opportunities for improvement along the way but as always, I had good support from my colleagues.
                | The success came as a team effort, in fact via several teams and hundreds of people!
              
              p
                | As an architect I never stop learning about how to engage with customers and stakeholders during projects. 
                | Tech stuff comes relatively easy to me but people stuff ... that's a whole different ball game.
                | That's an area I always have room and a need to improve on. (Need to look at some soft skills training
                | in our training catalogue.)

              h3 Capabilities Work

              p
                | The Capabilities Lead role feels like I am forever re-learning and re-inventing how to approach
                | the role. I'm given tremendous freedom in this role and so feedback is really important to keep
                | on track. I'm learning a lot from research and through working with others.
                
              p  
                | So far so good.

              h3 Personal Development Plan

              P
                | In hindsight, I've gone a little off piste with my personal development plan.
              
              p
                | One of the technical skills I set myself to master through
                | "doing" has taken a little bit of a back seat. I've learnt some adjacent skills related to it, which is kind
                | of okay but the main skill is still lacking hands-on time. (It's not something that affects my work as it relates to
                | a personal interest but it's something I want to bring into my work at some point in the future.)

              p
                | I've learnt loads so far this year and there's no signs of that changing when I look at the training
                | I'm still due to take and the certifications I intend to gain by the end of the year.

              h3 Productivity / Efficiency / Quality

              P
                | I need to automate some manual tasks that would improve my productivity / efficiency in terms of blog and 
                | website updates. This also includes some quality assurance activities like spell check, broken link check
                | etc. I'm still a DOS batch file guy and need to progress more on my Visual Code editor automation
                | and PowerShell scripting. (No excuse for not getting someone to quickly show me how to do this!)

              h3 Feedback Pending

              p
                | At time of writing, I still have some reflection to do based on feedback from my line manager
                | which I'm yet to receive and discuss. I expect that to influence how I approach my work going forwards.

              h2 Reflection Actions

              p 
                | Reflection time is most valuable when both lessons are learned and course-corrections are identified
                | which then result in positive action being taken.

              p
                | So far I've adjusted my personal development plan. This now takes into account the things that I'm currently
                | learning and receiving training for that I didn't anticipate doing at the start of the year and which
                | have impacted my technical learning objectives. (I didn't anticipate doing this blog either!ðŸ˜Š)

              p
                | I've also added the additional skills and achievements and decided to take a more "brute force" 
                | approach to my failing technical learning objective. To do this I've planned a specific, shorter term
                | goal (Q3) to focus on 
                | that will be baked into my blog website. It will serve as an intermediate stepping stone to my end goal
                | and feels like a realistic plan. Time will tell.
