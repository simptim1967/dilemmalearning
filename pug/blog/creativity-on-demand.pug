              h2 Taekwondo Lesson

              p
                img.mugshot.img-thumbnail.img-responsive(src='/images/good-idea-plan.jpg', alt='Good Idea Schedule', title='Good Idea Schedule')
                | Last month I went to watch a friend teach his weekly Taekwondo class. A couple of the younger students
                | were talking when they shouldn't have been and were singled out and asked to do ten press-ups
                | each for not paying attention. After immediately doing the press-ups focus was restored
                | and the class instruction resumed.

              p
                | It struck me at the time that whilst I might be able to do ten press-ups on demand, I can't just
                | go and have ten good ideas on demand.

              p
                | Even in this modern world, creativity is not something we
                | can just call up on demand. We wish! ðŸ˜Š

              h2 The Speed Of Creativity

              p
                | There are all sorts of things that we marvel at. Whether it's a film, art, a piece of music or perhaps
                | even nature, all these things take time to emerge but we never really find out just how much time
                | really went into something or how many failed prototypes or how much re-work or how far the finished thing
                | ended up being from the original idea.

              p
                | No sooner have we started to marvel at or ponder something then the next thing comes along and
                | our thoughts are taken elsewhere.

              P
                | It seems to me that creativity takes way longer than any of us would really care to admit whether
                | we like it or not. Creativity is often the culmination of many things over time.

              h2 Mental Blocks

              p
                | Mental blocks are like road blocks to our creative thoughts. They take ideas that are waiting
                | to be born into an elusive place as if forcing us to endure yet another lesson in patience.

              p
                | As an architect I have plenty of opportunities to be creative but I do find myself often needing
                | time and space to think and some things require much more thought than others.

              p
                | Even if I 
                a(href="/tricks/personal/03-hide-away-change-the-scenery.html", title="HIde Away And Change The Scenery") hide away and change the scenery
                |  and 
                a(href="/tricks/personal/04-avoid-distractions-and-occasional-interruptions.html", title="Avoid Distractions And Occasional Interruptions") avoid distractions and occasional interruptions
                |  those mental blocks can still stop me in my tracks like I'm waste deep in treacle.

              h2 Falling Into The Limitations Trap

              p
                | Mental blocks can be cruel and throwing thinking time at them doesn't always help, especially
                | when the reason is because you've fallen into the personal limitations trap!
                | When you realise you might actually be the blocker then it's time to get help.

              p
                | Bouncing your 
                | ideas off people can be really helpful and cause you to start seeing things from different angles
                | or to think about things you hadn't yet considered.
                | Asking multiple people may give you different views but don't expect everyone to immediately
                | be on page or as excited about things as you are.
                
              p
                | Even just beginning to explain things to someone can be a big help and may
                | trigger the "Eureka!" moment you've been striving for.

              h2 Getting The Creative Juices Flowing

              p
                | So how do you get those creative juices flowing? Not sure I have all the answers to this one so
                | here are a few tips my friendly search engine offered up that I'm working through:
                ul
                  li Relax
                  li Get some sleep
                  li Take a walk (dogs optional)
                  li Change your workspace
                  li Get some exercise
                  li Change your routine
                  li Take regular breaks to avoid burnout
                  li Don't repeat going over and over the same thing 
                  li Try to work to a plan
                  li Spend some time with a notepad: draw pictures and write notes
                  li Invent personas and use story boards
                  li Don't go it alone
                  li Talk to people
                  li Surround yourself with inspiration
                  li Don't just think about it - do or build something
                  li Imagine what the future might look like (send yourself an email from the future)

              p
                | If creativity is just the culmination of effort, skill and teamwork over time then
                | just persist. You'll get there eventually! Smugness will then be yours. ðŸ˜Š
