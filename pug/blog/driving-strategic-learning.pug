              h2 Targeted Learning Has Its Place

              img.img-thumbnail.img-responsive(src='/images/arrows-in-archery-target.jpg', alt='Targeted Learning Has Its Place', title='Targeted Learning Has Its Place')

              p
                | If you believe that technical skills are essential to on-going business success then
                | learning has to be a significant part of your strategy. This is especially true for big IT
                | companies like Capgemini.

              p  
                | You'll need to make time for your employees to learn, 
                | you'll need to give direction as to what needs to be learned and who by (and to explain why)
                | and you'll need to decide when by and make sure this learning takes place. 
              
              p
                | None of this is going to happen by itself or happen overnight.

              p 
                | You'll need a plan and to execute it just like a project.
                
              p  
                | Treating learning as a project
                | means gathering and monitoring 
                a(href="progress-metrics.html", title="Progress Metrics") progress metrics
                |  and course-correcting as necessary to stay on target.

              p
                | Learning projects are like painting the Forth Rail Bridge, by the time you've finished you'll
                | need to start all over again. ðŸ˜Š
              
              h2 Who Needs To Learn What

              p
                | You could leave people to their own devices in terms of what they choose to learn and to
                | what depth. There are times when this approach has its merits but if learning is to
                | be strategic then you'll need to identify and give direction as to who needs to learn what
                | and preferably when by.

              p
                | For example, embracing "agile techniques" may be essential for the whole organisation
                | whilst "containerisation"
                | might be specific to only certain teams, roles and departments.


              h2 Pyramid Learning Levels

              p
                | Different people in different roles will require different levels of learning
                | for each given subject. They will mostly need entry-level knowledge of many things
                | and expert-level knowledge of a few things. (Capgemini sees this as building "T-shaped"
                | people.)

              p
                | Learning levels typically follow a top-down pyramid shape. A few SMEs, more advanced practitioners,
                | even more with intermediate subject knowledge and the rest with entry-level knowledge. The
                | subjects and the numbers in the pyramid levels will vary between different teams and departments
                | based on the nature of the work that they perform.

              h2 Legislating For The Majority

              p
                | There should be a strong emphasis and wider provision for the entry-level knowledge
                | required by the majority
                | with a tapering off as subject matter becomes more advanced. This should align
                | directly with the needs of departments and teams. Training from basic to advanced should
                | work in the same way as should plans to gain certifications.

              p
                | Learning materials need to be easily accessible to all and well publicised in terms of
                | how and where to find them as well as why and who they need to be used by.

              p
                | I find our weekly Learning Cinema is an excellent way of introducing the masses to entry-level
                | knowledge for strategic subjects.

              h2 Scheduled Learning

              p
                | Just as you would schedule and track completion of project work you should also schedule
                | and track completion of learning activities.

              p
                | Recommending learning to people without a deadline or the ability to track who has completed
                | that learning is like sailing without a rudder: you'll end up somewhere but probably not 
                | where you intended.

              p
                | Scheduled learning and progress tracking is essential for learning project success.

              h2 Putting SMEs On Pedestals And On Show

              p
                | SMEs are special. They are highly skilled individuals requiring continuous investment to
                | keep them up-to-date with the latest and greatest in their subject. This investment may
                | come in the form of certification, training, conference attendance (sometimes in exotic locations ðŸ˜Š) or
                | even as equipment or time on proof-of-concept projects.

              p
                | We all know that every once in a while a SME will save the day (earning their pedestal)
                | but in the mean time they need to be "on show" contributing to pre-sales, proposals, projects, governance
                | and building people through technical communities and coaching.  

              h2 Proof Of Learning

              p
                | Proof of learning is a great differentiator in the market place.
                
              p
                | It's not just bragging about
                | the size of your training budget or the number of hours logged on training to date but rather about
                | the more tangible aspects of proof such as the number of certifications attained, SMEs
                | engaged as conference speakers
                | and ultimately project successes and customer references. 

              p
                | Today we exist in a very much more "show me, don't tell me" world so be ready with your credentials!
