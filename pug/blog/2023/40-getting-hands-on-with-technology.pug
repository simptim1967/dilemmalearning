              hr.featurette-divider

              h2 Beyond The Hype 

              p
                | Products are continually being introduced or updated offering new capabilities or resolving 
                | known issues that enable the creation of faster, better and cheaper solutions.   
                | Some claims may turn out to be nothing more than hype but for others there might well be some benefits, 
                | albeit with possible side effects, that merit further investigation.

              p 
                | When, for example, a claim is made that a new product is ten times quicker or simpler to use than a well known product
                | that you currently use heavily, you can't help but want to take a look to see if it's true, especially if it might improve 
                | quality or speed delivery. It's time to get hands-on.

              p 
                | Upgrading open source libraries can also introduce unexpected changes if you don't read the small print on the 
                | release notes carefully. I remember one particular library 
                | that introduced a new encryption mechanism on configuration data that dramatically impacted on performance
                | taking us outside of our customer Service Level Agreement (SLA).

              h2 Growing Your Capability 

              p
                | As a Technical Architect, it's really important to keep up with industry trends and technologies
                | (however self-indulgent or challenging that might be ðŸ˜Š). 
                | It's also desirable to go deep into some of those technologies in order to 
                | gain real expertise and earn / retain your SME (Subject Matter Expert) status. 
              
              p
                | There's only so much reading around that you can do before you have to roll
                | up your sleeves in order to put
                | theory into practice to see if it actually delivers on what it promises. It's time to get hands-on.

              p 
                | There's nothing like getting hands-on to really get a good understanding of how something actually works
                | and it may not at all line up to your original thinking based on what you read about the technology.

              p
                | Time spent with the "hood up" can often take you to 
                | a far deeper technical level of the technology in question and cause you to potentially re-think your design approach.
                | It can cause you to read up on some related areas of technology that you've not looked at before but now 
                | recognise as relevant to your design considerations. This happened to me when I was trying to improve my 
                | AWS CloudFront cache-hit ratio for this website.

              h2 Innovation Opportunity: Show Me, Don't Tell Me

              p 
                | New products and capabilities offer opportunities for innovation. It's one thing to talk about what might be 
                | done but it's another thing to demonstrate it. In my career I've seen a number of working prototypes turn into 
                | real product offerings and win big business as a result. The customer awards the prize to the one who can
                | "show me, don't tell me". ðŸ˜Š
                | (See my previous blog article entitled 
                a(href="opening-new-doors-to-new-possibilities.html", title="Opening New Doors To New Possibilities") Opening New Doors To New Possibilities
                =".)"

              p  
                | Dare to dream what technology might do! It's time to get hands-on.

              h2 Mitigating Risk Early

              p 
                | Whilst Project Managers are often highly risk averse, most architects fall into the "Risk Explorer"
                | category. That's because risk is an up-front consideration when selecting building blocks for solutions
                | and for proving that emergent designs meet the intentional architecture.

              p
                | Only proven building blocks will ever be considered but that doesn't prevent projects from exploring
                | different options by including proving activities in advance of building block selection.

              p 
                | Spike activities on Agile projects allow up-front proving of technologies. The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)
                | differentiates between 
                u features
                |  (things the customer wants) and 
                u enablers
                |  (things that enable developers to deliver the features that the customer wants) and
                | refers to this approach as "building the architectural runway". It's time to get hands-on.

              p 
                | The SAFe approach is advantageous because the architectural runway concept in effect supports up-front 
                | design (via a dedicated programme increment for the enabler functionality that will support implementation of
                | the new features in the
                | following programme increment) that might otherwise not be so successful when relying on purely emergent architecture.

              h2 IT Life Blood 

              p 
                | It's not enough to keep up with the conversation, you also need to stay in the game. 

              p 
                | Getting hands-on with technology is the life blood of any IT company. Failing to get hands-on
                | sees that life blood drain away and will ultimately cause the death of any IT company. 

              p 
                | Some people are just naturally wired to play with new technology and are often the first to lose interest 
                | when those technologies become business-as-usual. Such individuals are to be encouraged to explore new products
                | and share their learning.
                | (See my previous blog article entitled 
                a(href="/blog/starters-and-finishers.html", title="Starters And Finishers") Starters And Finishers
                =".)"

              p  
                | What time is it? Oh yeah, it's time to get hands-on!
