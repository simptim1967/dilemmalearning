              h2 Yet More New Kids On The Block

              p
                | I don‚Äôt know about you but in my role as an architect I am forever hearing about
                | new tools and technologies. They often have crazy names which I‚Äôm not even sure
                | how to spell at times. This is not anything new, in fact it happens all the time.
                | The question is, how do you deal with it?

              p
                | I started asking around to see how some of my colleagues deal with this. Most
                | said that they got their phone out and Googled it, perhaps under the table if
                | they were in a meeting. üòä
              
              p
                | Others said they had given up chasing down all things new because it took too
                | much effort to keep up with every new thing that they heard about.

              p
                | I‚Äôm not in love with my mobile phone so I sit in the middle of these two approaches.
                | I typically make a note in my learning diary and then pursue the look-up at some
                | other time that is suitable.

              h2 Curiosity Is Healthy And Rewarding

              p
                | I believe curiosity is healthy and rewarding (although perhaps not for cats).

              p
                | For those curious enough to resort to research, some kind of learning will inevitably
                | result. Those who adopt this approach tend to be the kind of people who already
                | know about something when someone presenting asks the audience to raise their hand
                | if they have heard of X or know something about it. (Of course some in this
                | situation deliberately avoid raising their hand in case they get asked to explain
                | it. üòä)

              h2 Curiosity Opens New Doors To New Possibilities

              p
                | Have you ever wondered how the trail blazers latch on to new things? It‚Äôs simple!
                | They choose to follow up on their curiosity beyond the point of research. Their
                | curiosity turns into doing something rather than just reading about it. These are
                | the people who click on the ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù link.

              p
                | In my book, it takes both ‚Äústarters‚Äù and ‚Äúfinishers‚Äù to do things well but we‚Äôd
                | be so stuck in the past without the ‚Äústarters‚Äù who get bored so quickly doing the
                | same thing day in, day out.

              p
                | Like training, curiosity opens new doors to new possibilities.

              h2 We Never Had It So Good

              p
                | Today, if you dare to experiment with cloud technologies, you‚Äôll soon discover it‚Äôs
                | easier than ever to build things. There is already a wealth of services out there
                | (most have three-letter acronyms) just waiting to be consumed and because much of
                | the hard work has been done by someone else for you (sample code provided), they
                | are very quick and easy to embrace.

              p
                | Many legacy solutions are so overdue a re-write! You would never build anything
                | today the way we built things in the past. The problem is that if we fail to follow
                | the healthy pursuit of continuous curiosity, legacy thinking will always hold us back.

              p
                | Get curious. Dare to discover new and better ways of doing things.

              p
                | Go on, challenge the status quo!
