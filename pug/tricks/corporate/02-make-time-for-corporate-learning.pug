              h2 Corporate Learning Is A Must

              p
                | Failing to make time for corporate learning is like planning to fail.

              p
                | If you are not yet convinced that corporate learning is a must then you may want to read
                | my article entitled 
                a(href="../../blog/the-continuous-learning-dilemma.html", title="The Continuous Learning Dilemma") "The Continuous Learning Dilemma"
                | . Hopefully this will help you to recognise that learning must be treated
                | as an essential part of work for your staff and is therefore a priority.

              h2 No Time For Learning

              p
                | If your staff are focussing 100% on customer work then they can rightly say
                | they "don't have time to learn".

              p  
                | It can be a real problem if managers
                | are not committed to helping and encouraging staff to make time 
                | for learning due to pressures of meeting short term targets or thinking that 
                | time spent on learning will decrease productivity.

              h2 Help And Encourage Staff To Make Time For Learning 

              P
                | Managers must advocate for their staff by helping and encouraging them to
                | make time for learning. Learning should be an expected part of work rather
                | than separate to it. 
                
              p
                | Some organisations allocate a specific block of time on a particular day each week
                | for all of their staff to participate in learning activities at the same time and 
                | then encourage sharing of those learning experiences.

              p
                | It may feel uncomfortable or somewhat of a leap of faith to take such a decision but 
                | you are highly likely to reap rewards from doing so.

              h2 Learning Is Not New

              p
                | Learning is happening all the time in the workplace, both formally and informally. 
                | Emphasizing that learning is an expected part of work draws attention to it
                | and encourages participation. 

              h2 Great Things Come From Small Beginnings

              p
                | Start small by encouraging your staff to set aside a regular time for learning each week
                | and to make learning a routine part of their normal work activities.
                | This may be at a time to individually suit them, or collectively at an agreed time each week.
                | Encourage staff to share their learning experiences.

              p 
                | If your staff are continually learning and developing, you will reach your targets
                | more easily. Learning brings benefits in itself but is also a very effective means to an end.
                | You'll soon also discover that staff morale improves and attrition is reduced.
