                | Procrastination is a psychological habit of self-defeating behaviour, favouring short term
                | benefits with long term costs. Multi-tasking contributes to procrastination.
                | It's a vicious and unproductive cycle that can lead to stress. ðŸ˜’

              p
                | We sometimes get into a state of randomly starting small unimportant things and then switching to something
                | else before we've really achieved anything and before we know it we've passed some
                | time but have nothing much to show for it. (The big important things still need doing.)

              p
                | We might be anxious and continually checking our email or social media, wondering why no one
                | has liked or responded to a recent post, or distracted by texts, instant messages or notifications
                | demanding our attention.

              p
                | Or we may just spend time endlessly thinking about what we should be doing because there are so many
                | things we need to do and want to achieve but alas, where to start?

              p
                | Whatever the reason, it's time to stop procrastinating and start getting things done!

              h2 Breaking Free From Procrastination

              p
                | Here are some simple steps you can take to break the chains of procrastination that are holding you back:
                ul
                  li Stop trying to do too many things (limit your work)
                  li Stop being so ambitious and trying to achieve perfection (start simple and build up)
                  li Break big tasks down into smaller tasks
                  li Prioritise tasks
                  li Make a plan at the start of each day (schedule your work for the day)
                  li Time box your effort (remember to include variety and breaks)
                  li Execute your plan (stick to it)
                  li Reward yourself for getting things done (Yay! ðŸ˜Š)
