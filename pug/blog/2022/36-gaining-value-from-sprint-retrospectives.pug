              h2 Avoid Just Ticking The Box 

              p
                | When you and your team have been sprinting for a while, you need to make sure that your Sprint Retrospectives
                | remain a regular event and don't 
                | become just a tick-box activity that fail to deliver any real value. 

              h2 The Continuous Improvement Ethos

              p 
                | Agile has always embraced the Continuous Improvement ethos and hopefully your team does too.

              p 
                | Remember the 
                a(href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html") Twelve Principles of Agile Software
                |  development? Principle 12 states: "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective,
                | then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly." (Strange how the Agile Manifesto itself hasn't been updated
                | in years. Steve McConnell thinks 
                a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EywFDr1pHqs",target="_blank") 20 Years is Enough! Itâ€™s Time to Update the Agile Principles and Values
                |.)

              p 
                | The 
                a(href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide", target="_blank") Scrum Guide
                |  says that the purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness and therefore 
                | supports principle 12 as a recurring reminder to drive continuous improvement with each iteration.

              p 
                | Whilst the focus of the sprint is often primarily on the business value of the potentially shippable product
                | increment under construction, teams must not forget to also focus on the delivery of strategic value through the
                | achievement of continuous learning and improvement. (See previous blog articles: 
                a(href="/blog/two-customers.html") Two Customers
                |  and 
                a(href="/blog/building-people-then-products.html") Building People, Then Products
                |.)

              h2 Plan-Do-Check-Act 

              p 
                | The Scrum ceremonies map well onto the "Plan-Do-Check-Act" lifecycle with the Sprint Retrospective 
                | being intended as the "Check-Act" part of that lifecycle.
              
              p
                | Doing too little or too much checking without taking any actions will make retrospectives feel unproductive
                | and fuel the "why bother to contribute when nothing ever gets done" attitude within your team. 

              p 
                | However, taking on too many improvement actions at one time can also introduce too much change too soon,
                | causing disarray 
                | within your team if things don't quite work out as anticipated.

              h2 Encouraging Full Team Participation 

              p 
                | Invite the Product Owner and their colleagues. 
                | They may choose not to attend (and that's sometimes helpful ðŸ˜Š)
                | but it demonstrates the spirit of transparency which helps to build trust and confidence with your customer.
                | After all, any views your customer has about what needs to improve are extremely important so why 
                | would you fail to ask them? Sometimes it's the customer that needs to improve too.

              p 
                | You may need to coach some of your "quieter" people outside of retrospectives to remind them to bring
                | up a specific item from a prior conversation
                | during the retrospective and may even need to prompt them on the day. Hopefully it will boost their confidence 
                | going forwards as well as start a useful debate.

              p 
                | Recently, someone raised a great point right at the very last minute of the meeting. None-the-less it was 
                | greatly appreciated.

              h2 Keep It Fresh And Fun

              p 
                | Sprint retrospectives can easily become stale if you don't make an effort to keep them fresh,  
                | especially if the continuous improvement ethos is not alive and kicking in your team culture.

              p 
                | Retrospectives can often take the form of a team discussion to answer three questions:
                ul
                  li What went well?
                  li What didn't go so well?
                  li What or how can we improve?

              p  
                | Whilst these are helpful questions to drive useful 
                | conversations, using the same meeting format in the same location with the same people on each occasion can cause 
                | that "same old, same old" feeling to set in and take the edge off your good intentions. 

              p 
                | It's helpful to vary the meeting format (and perhaps the person running the event) to keep things fresh
                | and fun. There's nothing to stop you from communicating 
                | your intentions in advance so that the team can come prepared.

              p 
                | There are plenty of good books and websites discussing different approaches to retrospectives that you might want to try.
                | (See 
                a(href="https://medium.com/agile-outside-the-box/looking-for-a-new-retrospective-technique-try-one-of-these-19a109b1f1cd") Try One of These
                |  for example.)

              h2 Come Prepared

              p 
                | It's not enough for people to just turn up to a retrospective. People need to come prepared.

              p 
                | Many improvement opportunities are lost through lack of preparation. ðŸ˜’

              p 
                | Relying on your memory usually isn't enough. I find that keeping notes throughout a sprint 
                | helps me remember what I observed and prepares me for the retrospective. Even the Sprint Review that precedes the 
                | retrospective can provide numerous feedback items and suggestions for improvements.  

              p 
                | Preparation can be as simple as keeping a notepad on your desk (or a text file on your desktop)
                | and simply jotting down notes as matters arise during the current sprint.

              p 
                | Before COVID-19, I sometimes stood at the doorway of the meeting room and wouldn't let people into the meeting 
                | until they could prove that they had done some kind of preparation. People soon got the message.

              p 
                | Come prepared to be challenged. Sometimes it can feel like a negative experience when the feedback isn't what 
                | you had hoped for or expected. Perhaps some complaints or criticisms were surfaced that will need to be addressed.

              h2 Beware Techniques That Discourage Full Team Involvement 

              p 
                | Just because you invited everyone and they turned up is no guarantee 
                | that everyone will get involved and contribute! 

              p 
                | Just like Planning Poker encourages everyone to estimate a story and disclose their estimate at the same time,
                | make sure that you don't use an approach or tooling 
                | that allows others to see or agree with someone else's suggestions before submitting their own and that ultimately
                | discourages full team participation.

              p 
                | Before COVID-19 forced remote working on our entire team, we would conduct our retrospectives in a 
                | large room with team members writing their comments on sticky notes and all posting on the wall at
                | the same time. This approach encouraged everyone to participate and we were able to group duplicate items. 

              p 
                | Switching to remote working and use of software tooling for capturing feedback, we saw the number of comments
                | reducing and so had to re-consider our approach to boost participation.

              p
                | Having a very large project team also reduced participation and so we opted to revert back to
                | individual retrospectives per scrum team instead of using a combined project-level event with
                | all our scrum teams. 

              h2 Keep It Safe And Fair 

              p 
                | People will contribute to the retrospective when they feel it is safe and when they are given  
                | the appropriate opportunity to do so. 

              p 
                | Retrospectives should always be a safe place to discuss things with almost no topic off limit and with everyone
                | having equal opportunity to voice their views, suggestions and/or concerns.
              
              p
                | A "no names, no blame" culture should exist with the agreement that all feedback must be constructive.

              p
                | Allow anonymous feedback if necessary but don't encourage this to be the norm.
              
              p
                | Many improvement opportunities are also lost because of lack of involvement. ðŸ˜’

              p
                | Don't allow highly-vocal or overly-opinionated individuals to dominate the air time.
                | Try to give everyone equal opportunity and time to contribute. By getting the whole team involved and 
                | contributing you'll 
                | be giving your team the best chance to surface all potential issues and suggestions.

              h2 Remember To Give Yourselves A Pat On The Back 

              p 
                | Don't just see the challenges but also recognise your successes.

              p 
                | There are many benefits to positive affirmation so don't miss the opportunity to bolster team morale 
                | and point out the great work that's been done despite any challenges that the team faced. People love praise!

              p 
                | It's great to accolade people and highlight clear areas of improvement that have been achieved this sprint 
                | or that continue to improve from previous sprints.

              h2 Discussion Is Valuable But Time Is Limited
              
              p 
                | Sprint retrospectives are time-boxed and the duration typically equates to one hour per week of sprint 
                | (i.e. a two-week sprint has a two hour retrospective) but this time does not include preparation time.

              p 
                | Sometimes there will be a myriad of discussion points and simply not enough time to discuss everything. Whilst 
                | you might run out of time, it doesn't mean you have to drop everything and forget all the good discussion
                | points that were raised. You should also avoid getting sidetracked by "low value" topics.

              p
                | By taking note of the useful discussion points identified you can organise follow-up meetings to discuss some of them 
                | in more detail. (
                a(href="http://leancoffee.org", target="_blank") Lean Coffee
                |  meetings can be a useful way of achieving and prioritising that.) 

              h2 Have A Strategic Roadmap

              p 
                | Lack of time is never a valid excuse for failing to improve.

              p  
                | Having a strategic roadmap can drive serious improvements over the longer term that 
                | may take several sprints to achieve. Recognise such opportunities and allow people to take ownership of 
                | them so that they can turn them into successful achievements.

              h2 Actions Speak Louder Than Words

              p 
                | To birth improvements means changing what you do and/or how you do it. (Strange how it takes some people
                | longer than others to figure that out! ðŸ˜Š)  

              p 
                | Sometimes there are so many suggested improvement actions that it's hard to decide exactly which to focus on
                | and for this reason some teams restrict the choices by voting to decide the top three improvements to try out.

              p 
                | Some suggestions may also be more radical than others and really challenge the status quo. This can be innovation
                | at its best or surface vocal confrontation from your resident change resistors!
                | (Some people just don't like change. ðŸ˜’)

              p
                | Trialling different suggestions in different scrum teams can yield interesting results.

              h2 Breaking Chains / Killing Sacred Cows 

              p 
                | As someone who has coached many Agile teams over the years, I've seen a whole range of reactions to suggested 
                | improvements: whether to ways of working, adoption of a new technique or switching tool choices and
                | recognise that it can take a variety of approaches, and sometimes real people skills, to 
                | convince some people (or even a whole teams) to embrace change before breakthrough can happen.

              p 
                | Rome wasn't built in a day and I've seen many a change resistor eventually sing the praises of the very
                | changes they once vehemently opposed. Sweet! ðŸ˜Š

              p 
                | As a result, my deep respect goes to those charismatic winners of hearts and minds knowing that
                | disruption is only half of the battle! ðŸ˜Š

              h2 Record Everything 

              p 
                | For an accurate record, don't dismiss anything out of hand but rather record all feedback, suggestions and 
                | agreed actions for posterity as well as the list of attendees.

              h2 Hold A Retrospective Of Retrospectives

              p 
                | Continuous improvement is an infinite loop. It never ends. It may even be recursive! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜’

              p 
                | Reflecting on your retrospectives over time will help you determine and improve their effectiveness
                | and is therefore a valuable exercise that I would recommend doing from time to time.

              p 
                | I'd also recommend the Spotify technique I saw some years ago called "
                a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oUBmTImb5w", target="_blank") Definition Of Awesome
                | " where teams agree what "awesome" would look like for them and then work out their next steps
                | to march towards it. (This technique works well alongside a strategic roadmap.)

              p 
                | Both can help you prove (or disprove) that you are really making progress. Good luck with that!

              h2 Agile Health Check - Sprint Retrospective 

              p
