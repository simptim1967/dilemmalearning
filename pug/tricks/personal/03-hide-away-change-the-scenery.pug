                | Not all environments are suitable for learning, especially if you work in
                | a busy office. Sometimes a change of scenery is called for in order to find
                | somewhere more ambient to learning.
                
              p
                | Think of the list of your requirements for the
                | perfect learning environment and then go find it.

                | It might look like this:
                ul
                  li Quiet
                  li Hidden away from or out of sight of colleagues

              p
                | At Capgemini we have a flexible policy around seating that you might know as the term
                | ‚Äúhot desking‚Äù. We have a mobile app that lets us find and book a desk. It even has an
                | Alexa skill to command it ‚Äì so cool! (Imagine me eating my breakfast and saying
                | ‚ÄúAlexa, book me a desk‚Äù.)

              p
                | I‚Äôm not personally a fan of ‚Äúhot desking‚Äù but I make it work to my advantage when
                | needed as I‚Äôm able to hide myself away in a different location to avoid interruptions
                | and to also change the
                | scenery once in a while. You could call it a "secret hideaway" learning environment.

              p
                | Some of my software engineering team colleagues hired a place in the country for a week
                | in order to conduct a Hack Week to learn new skills. The place had wonderful views, my
                | kind of local cuisine and even had a hot tub! üòä

                |  then you probably should too. Go on, give me ten good ideas right now! It's not
                | that easy is it? 

              p
                | Most of my ideas come from research but that doesn't mean that every idea I have is a
                | good idea. Some ideas don't make it after you've had time to think them through,
                | sleep on them or bounce them off colleagues.
                
              p
                | Having space to think is the important thing and often on your personal learning
                | journey you will have to appraise your progress and perhaps adjust your plans and
                | priorities.

              p
                | The office I work in is pretty big so there are lots of ‚Äúhiding places‚Äù that are not
                | too far away (such as our office canteen) but when I really want a change of scenery I work from a totally different office
                | or at home. I find this can really help energise approaching a new or challenging piece of work or
                | inspiring some fresh thinking. Try it once in a while and see if it works for you too.
